### Welcome to Rick's Personal Development Environment ðŸ‘‹


#### I'm Currently Learning Data Science
I am learning Data Science to quantify different aspects of the various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) projects that I'm working on personally or with my students.  I need help with Python, R, Keras, openCV, TensorFlow, JupyterLab, Git, and GitHub.

#### About Me
I went to school at Florida Institute of Technology.  My first job was in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Lab (SAIL) at the Johnson Spaceflight Center during the first five Space Shuttle Flights.  Programming languages that I have experience with are BASIC, FORTAN, Pascal, C, and various assembly languages.  My preference is working on embedded code rather than enterprise applications.  I worked for Litton in their government and commercial navigation systems divisions.  Was Director of Operations for a card access manufacturer and then a management and business consultant.  Currently run the Insitute for Applied STEM at Valor Christian High School while consulting on the side under my company Red Ocher Solutions.
